Master's student in Data Science at Bocconi University with a strong focus on advanced statistics, machine learning, and AI research.
My experience spans analyzing economic network data for my bachelor's thesis to developing multimodal neural networks with Wasserstein autoencoders as part of my current research assistantship.
I have additionally developed experience in reinforcement learning, NLP and text analysis, anomaly detection algorithms, agentic LLM frameworks, portfolio optimization, classification and forecasting machine learning methods, and web scraping techniques.
Passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to solve complex problems and advance innovation.
